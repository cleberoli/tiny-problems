"""Offers implementations of basic geometric concepts and objects.

The geometry classes represent geometric entities like points, hyperplanes, and even complex
structures like Voronoi diagrams. The classes here are independent in the sense they can be
initialized freely as long as you respect the parameters.

Note that some of this concepts are based upon another ones, e.g. a hyperplane is constructed
based on given points.
