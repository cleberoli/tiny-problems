"""Implementation for designing small decision trees to solve NP-hard problems.

This module contains all implementations as experiments described in the associated paper.
Its structure is divided into seven main modules (geometry, graph, instances, lp, polytopes,
trees, and utils). There are also two additional modules (benchmark and generated) that are
responsible for running the experiments and validating the results.
